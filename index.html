            <h2>Skeletal System</h2>
            <img src="images/skeletal-system.jpg" alt="Skeletal System" class="responsive-img">
            <p>The skeletal system provides the framework for the body. It is composed of bones, cartilage, and ligaments. The human skeleton has 206 bones, which support and protect the body's organs and enable movement.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Skull:</strong> Protects the brain and forms the structure of the face.</li>
                <li><strong>Spine:</strong> Supports the body and houses the spinal cord. It is made up of 33 vertebrae.</li>
                <li><strong>Rib Cage:</strong> Protects the heart and lungs. It consists of 12 pairs of ribs.</li>
                <li><strong>Pelvis:</strong> Supports the weight of the upper body and protects the pelvic organs.</li>
                <li><strong>Limbs:</strong> Include the bones of the arms and legs, which facilitate movement and interaction with the environment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="muscular-system">
            <h2>Muscular System</h2>
            <img src="images/muscular-system.jpg" alt="Muscular System" class="responsive-img">
            <p>The muscular system is responsible for movement, stability, and posture. It consists of three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Skeletal Muscles:</strong> Attached to bones and responsible for voluntary movements. Examples include the biceps and quadriceps.</li>
                <li><strong>Smooth Muscles:</strong> Found in the walls of internal organs like the stomach, intestines, and blood vessels. They control involuntary movements.</li>
                <li><strong>Cardiac Muscle:</strong> Found only in the heart. It is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="nervous-system">
            <h2>Nervous System</h2>
            <img src="images/nervous-system.jpg" alt="Nervous System" class="responsive-img">
            <p>The nervous system controls and coordinates all body activities. It consists of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Central Nervous System (CNS):</strong> Comprises the brain and spinal cord. The brain processes and interprets sensory information, while the spinal cord transmits signals between the brain and the rest of the body.</li>
                <li><strong>Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):</strong> Consists of nerves that branch out from the CNS to the rest of the body. It is divided into the somatic nervous system (controls voluntary movements) and the autonomic nervous system (controls involuntary functions).</li>
                <li><strong>Autonomic Nervous System:</strong> Subdivided into the sympathetic (prepares the body for stress-related activities) and parasympathetic (conserves energy and restores the body to a resting state) nervous systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="digestive-system">
            <h2>Digestive System</h2>
            <img src="images/digestive-system.jpg" alt="Digestive System" class="responsive-img">
            <p>The digestive system breaks down food into nutrients, which the body uses for energy, growth, and cell repair. It includes several organs that work together to convert food into energy and basic nutrients to feed the entire body.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mouth:</strong> The starting point of the digestive tract. Chewing breaks food into smaller pieces, and saliva begins the chemical breakdown.</li>
                <li><strong>Esophagus:</strong> A muscular tube that transports food from the mouth to the stomach using rhythmic muscle contractions called peristalsis.</li>
                <li><strong>Stomach:</strong> Secretes acid and enzymes that digest food. The stomach muscles churn food to enhance digestion.</li>
                <li><strong>Small Intestine:</strong> Divided into three parts (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum). It continues the process of breaking down food using enzymes and absorbs nutrients into the bloodstream.</li>
                <li><strong>Large Intestine:</strong> Absorbs water and forms waste (feces). It includes the colon, rectum, and anus.</li>
                <li><strong>Liver:</strong> Produces bile, which helps digest fats. It also detoxifies chemicals and metabolizes drugs.</li>
                <li><strong>Pancreas:</strong> Produces digestive enzymes and bicarbonate, which are released into the small intestine to aid digestion.</li>
                <li><strong>Gallbladder:</strong> Stores and concentrates bile from the liver, releasing it into the small intestine to help digest fats.</li>
            </ul>
